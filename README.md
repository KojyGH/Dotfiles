Personal repository to store my Dotfiles. Feel free to clone and play with them!

## What is a dotfile?
*Dotfiles* is a term to indicate configuration files, most of the cases they are stored in '/home/user/.config'. With the dotfiles, you manipulate and configure programs, obviously if they have any of them.
